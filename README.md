A browser extension that replaces your "New Tab" page with a bookmarks manager. Made because the standard chrome bookmarks manager sucks.

Currently there it is not listed on the chrome extensions store, but will be after the following features have been completed:
* ~~SideNav drag-and-drop functionality~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* Pinned bookmarks

There will be more features too, such as:
* A search bar
* Customizable theme
* And other features still being floated

Suggestions for even more features are greatly appreciated.
